fix req_args problem in relation to t_s_pct (probably put fixed values in t_s_pct and pointers to those values in fixed args

add a max_position to g_ps
add a count of raw stars and conversion specifers to g_ps
these two so that it might be possible to declare an array of the right length for the args.

decide which lists to convert to arrays
