write ca_prefix and ca_body
create functions that assign buffers with length and return length, for valb and sign
fix output_nan_inf, there is place, it should be more legible
finish writing the valtobuffer functions, use them in convert_a.c
rewrite the output_nan and output_inf using callbacks with output_padnstuff
rewrite the refresh_parse_state() in parse_format_string.c
forgot to wrap the chunks in the chunk wrapper.

add a max_position to g_ps
add a count of raw stars and conversion specifers to g_ps
these two so that it might be possible to declare an array of the right length for the args.

decide which lists to convert to arrays


rewrite the whole thing with just one list of required arguments whose members hold a pointer to the value that needs to be filled.
